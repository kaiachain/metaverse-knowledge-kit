# ðŸ’¼ Tools and SDKs <a id="tools-and-sdks"></a>

There are a variety of open source tools to help developers utilize Kaia smart contract library. This guide provides a list of such tools to help your smart contract builds.

* **[Kaia Dapp Mono](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia-dapp-mono)**: collection of different contracts, languages, dApp examples and  libraries that work with Kaia.

* **[Kaia Online Toolkit](https://toolkit.kaia.io/)**: This provides code samples and pages to help you utilize the Kaia SDK(caver-js). With the Online Toolkit, you can derive the code to deploy your Kaia contracts using caver-js. This contract includes [KIP7](https://toolkit.kaia.io/kct/KIP7Deploy), [KIP17](https://toolkit.kaia.io/kct/KIP17Deploy),  [KIP37](https://toolkit.kaia.io/kct/KIP37Deploy) and other [Kaia Compatible Tokens(KCT)](https://toolkit.kaia.io/kct/KCTDetection). The online toolkit also gives users the functionality of interacting with deployed contracts given its ABI, contract address.

* **[Kaia Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.kaia.io/)**: This is an interactive generator to bootstrap your smart contract and learn about Kaia Contracts. This is based on [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/).
